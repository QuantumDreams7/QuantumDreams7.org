The infections, came from space. They have been here a long long time. They are not from some other "dimension", they are from this realm but humans cannot see them, cannot smell them, cannot feel them, cannot hear them. I can.


These are strangest kind of creatures. They lump up into each other and forming massive blobs, they hide in the clouds. They infect both the body and the soul. They drop their spores from the clouds and these travel with rain and wind all over Earth. The spores are not very big, usually small like dots but some can be as big as a small apple. They are heavily concentrated in big cities with large population. They spread into streets, shops, homes, beaches, public bathrooms and many other places.


They infect a human mostly from the feet, they don't move very fast, usually they just sit somewhere until a human steps on them. Once you step on one of these, they attach themselves into your feet. They like to sit in corners of the walls too and drop on humans but that happens rarely. After the initial attachment to a human, they very very slowly move upwards towards the neck area. The movement is extremely slow so that the human or other humans around this human do not notice any rapid fast  change in the infected one. After they ran the neck area, they start to burrow into the neck and brain. Then they stop for a while and sit dormant for a random amount of time. It can be a few days or weeks or months or even years. Upon coming out of this dormant period, they slowly start to detach and peel off the human's soul from the body. This process is also very slow.
