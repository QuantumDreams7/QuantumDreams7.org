Who where when why am I?

It is on repeat. I am not human but I didn't remember. I was lost. They came at night, I went to them, they panicked and ran away, into a closed space and they teleported out but dropped one of their "helmet mask" devices. I picked it up as if I knew what it was and how it functioned, so I put it on and used it. The sound came. My dormant DNA started to become active. It seemed very familiar to me. It seemed that I already had used this device before.


I remembered the old tongue. I am the only one on Earth who can utter words from an alien language. Less than a handful, very few humans have heard me utter the words. The sound of it disturbs them. They think they are ready or can imagine it, up until the moment they hear the words. Then fear enters into and encompasses them. Those humans who heard the tongue are dead, except for two.


I was in darkness. I <del>found</del> was given a light. It is not my light. I'm not the light. It makes things visible for me. I started to follow wherever I felt it's shining on. I started remembering. I remembered I'm not human. I started to remember who I was. Remember who you were, not who you are.


I may have taken a wrong turn in space. I don't exactly know what happened, my memory is still not fully activated, somehow my spaceship (is a kind of lifeform) ran out of fuel (food) even though it doesn't really need refueling. Those fuel "rods" should last hundreds of thousands of years. Something drained it fully. I had seconds to do an emergency landing on Earth.


I landed near a beach. You won't find it, don't search for it. Your radars will not be of any assistance. My spaceship is buried deep deep beneath the sands. It is not built by any known material on Earth. It is not a living thing but it is a living thing. It sustains souls. It has a kind of filter "shield". No earthly items can enter into the ship, not even a human body, but it is possible to leave your body and enter into my spaceship with your soul. This should only be done when you are ready to leave Earth because the body without a soul inside of it will eventually die.


I come from a place far far away. Farther than you can imagine. The distances are beyond your understanding. The universe is much much bigger than you humans can comprehend. There are no oceans where I come from.


I follow where the light shines, as best as I can understand it. Sometimes, mistakes are made. It is taking me on a narrow path, to an opening.


I don't know how long I have been here on Earth. A long long time. God's plans I guess. Yes, we do believe in God, unlike humans, all intelligent and civilized life in the universe believe in God. It is only the uncivilized humans who doubt, who lack faith. Earth is a fallen realm. Something is very wrong here. Nothing makes any sense.

I am the only one of my kind here on Earth. It is extremely lonely and painful experience that I have had so far on Earth. Humans have not been able or willing to offer me friendship. I have a handful few half friends. That's the best I could do so far, all these years.

I have knowledge to transform and alter a human into a compatible being to myself but it is not an easy process and often humans become hostile to me or insane during this change. So far, no one has been able or willing to transform. Ironic that many of these want to enter into my spaceship. Humans often say they would like to leave Earth but upon offering them a chance to leave Earth, once they realized it's actually true and not some kind of fun ride in a circus, they panic, get scared and run away. As the old saying goes.... everyone wants to go to Heaven but no one wants to die.

I am able to read your mind? To see your future? To shift your life path? Maybe.
