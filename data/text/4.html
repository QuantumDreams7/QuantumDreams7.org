Who where when what why am I?

I am not human but I didn't remember. I was lost. They came at night, I went to them, they panicked and ran away but dropped one of their "helmet mask" devices. I picked it up as if I knew what it was and how it functioned, so I put it on and used it. The sound came. My dormant DNA started to become active.


I remembered the old tongue. I am the only one on Earth who can utter words from an alien language. Less than a handful, very few humans have heard me utter the words. The sound of it disturbs them. They think they are ready or can imagine it, up until the moment they hear the words. Then fear enters them.


I was in darkness. I <del>found</del> was given a light. It is not my light. I'm not the light. It makes things visible for me. I started to follow it. I started remembering. I remembered I'm not human. I started to remember who I was.


I think took a wrong turn in space. I don't exactly know what happened, somehow my spaceship ran out of fuel even though it doesn't really need refueling. Those fuel "rods" should last hundreds of thousands of years. Something drained it fully. I had seconds to do an emergency landing on Earth.


I landed near a beach. You won't find it, don't search for it. Your radars will not be of any assistance. My spaceship is buried deep deep beneath the sands. It is not built by any known material on Earth. It is not a living thing but it is a living thing. It sustains souls.


I come from a place far far away. Farther than you can imagine. The distances are beyond your understanding. The universe is much much bigger than you humans can comprehend.


I follow where the light shines, as best as I can understand it. Sometimes, mistakes are made. It is taking me on a narrow path, to an opening.


I don't know when, I don't know how long I have been here on Earth. A long long time. God's plans I guess. Yes, we do believe in God, unlike humans, all intelligent and civilized life in the universe believe in God. It is only the uncivilized humans who doubt, who lack faith. Earth is a fallen realm. Something is very wrong here. Nothing makes any sense.
